Pastas: what is it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pastas is an open source python package for processing, simulating and analyzing 
hydrological time series (models). The object oriented stucture allows for the 
quick implementation of new model components. Time series models can be created,
calibrated, and analysed with just a few lines of python code with the built-in 
optimization, visualisation, and statistical analysis tools.

Documentation & Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Documentation is provided on a dedicated website: http://pastas.readthedocs.io/
- Examples can be found on the `examples directory on the documentation website <http://pastas.readthedocs.io/en/dev/examples.html>`_.
- View and edit a working example notebook of a Pastas model in `MyBinder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pastas/pastas/master?filepath=examples%2Fnotebooks%2F1_basic_model.ipynb>`_
- A list of Publications that used Pastas is available in a `dedicated GitHub repo <https://github.com/pastas/pastas_research>`_
