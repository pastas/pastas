Contributing to PASTAS
======================

Since PASTAS is an open-source framework, it depends on the Open Source Community for continuous development of the software. Any help in maintaining the code, writing or updating documentation is more than welcome. Please take a look at the developers section on the documentation website for more information on how to contribute to the development of PASTAS.
