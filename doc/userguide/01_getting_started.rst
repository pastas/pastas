Getting started with Pastas
===========================
On this page you will find all the information to get started with Pastas.
A basic knowledge of programming in Python is assumed, but nothing more than
that. See the Examples section for some example-code.

Installing Python
-----------------
To install Pastas, a working version of Python 3.9 or higher has to be
installed on your computer. We recommend using the `Anaconda Distribution
<https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution>`_ of Python. This Python
distribution includes most of the python package dependencies and the
Jupyter Lab integrated development environment (IDE) to run the notebooks.
However, you are free to install any Python IDE distribution you want.

Installing Pastas
-----------------
To install Pastas, there are several options available. The easiest is to
use the Python Package Index (`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_),
where many official python packages are gathered. To get the latest version
of Pastas, open the Anaconda Prompt, a Windows Command Prompt (also called
command window) or a Mac/Linux terminal and type::

    pip install pastas

Pastas will now be installed on your computer, including the packages
necessary for Pastas to work properly (called dependencies in Python
language). To install Pastas with the optional dependencies use::

    pip install pastas[full]

It sometimes occurs that the automatic installation of the dependencies
does not work. A safe method to update another package if you are
using Anaconda is to install a package with the follow command line::

    conda install package

Updating Pastas
---------------
If you have already installed Pastas, it is possible to update Pastas
easily. To update, open a Anaconda/Windows command prompt or a Mac
terminal and type::

    pip install pastas --upgrade

Dependencies
------------
Pastas depends on a number of Python packages, of which all of the necessary are
automatically installed when using the pip install manager. To summarize, the
following packages are necessary for a minimal function installation of
Pastas::

    numpy
    pandas
    scipy
    matplotlib
    numba  #(significant speed-up)

Other optional, but recommended dependencies include::

    jupyter  #(for running notebooks)
    lmfit  #(alternative solver)
    latexify #(visualising formula's of functions)
