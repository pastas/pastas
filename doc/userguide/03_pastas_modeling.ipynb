An introduction to `pandas` `timeseries` can be found, for example, [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mbakker7/exploratory_computing_with_python/blob/master/notebook8_pandas/py_exploratory_comp_8_sol.ipynb).

    "### Adding a StressModel\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the stresses that are expected to cause the observed head variation to the model. In this example, this is only the recharge series. For each stess, a `StressModel` object needs to be created. Each `StressModel` object needs three input arguments: the time series of the stress, the response function that is used to simulate the effect of the stress, and a name. In addition, it is recommended to specified the `kind` of series, which is used to perform a number of checks on the series and fix problems when needed. This checking and fixing of problems (for example, what to substitute for a missing value) depends on the kind of series. In this case, the time series of the stress is stored in the variable `recharge`, the Gamma function is used to simulate the response, the series will be called `'recharge'`, and the kind is `prec` which stands for precipitation. One of the other keyword arguments of the `StressModel` class is `up`, which means that a positive stress results in an increase (up) of the head. The default value is `True`, which we use in this case as a positive recharge will result in the heads going up. Each `StressModel` object needs to be stored in a variable, after which it can be added to the model. "
