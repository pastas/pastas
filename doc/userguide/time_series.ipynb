    "Time series data are a set of data values measured at certain times, ordered in a way that the time indices are increasing. Many time series analysis and modeling methods require that the time step between the measurements is always the same or in other words, equidistant. Such regular time series may have missing data, but those may be filled so that computations can be done with a constant time step. Hydraulic heads are often measured at irregular time intervals; such time series are called irregular. This is especially true for historic time series that were measured by hand. The figure below graphically shows the difference between the three types of time series."

    "### Independent and dependent time series \n",
    "\n",
    "We can differentiate between two types of input time series for Pastas models: the dependent and independent time series. The dependent time series are those that we want to explain/model (e.g., the groundwater levels), and are referred to as the `oseries` in pastas (short for observation series). The independent time series are those that we use to model the dependent time series (e.g., precipitation or evaporation), and are referred to as `stresses` in Pastas. The requirements for these time series are different:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dependent time series may be of any kind: regular, missing data or irregular.\n",
    "- The stress time series must have regular time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A word on timestamps and measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "Stresses often represent a flux measured over a certain time period. For example, precipitation is often provided in mm/day, and the value represents the cumulative precipitation amount for a day. This is recorded at the end of the day, e.g., a measurement with a time stamp of 2000-01-01 represents the total precipitation that fell on the first of January in the year 2000.\n",

    "## The Python package for time series data: `pandas`\n",

    "The `pandas` package provides a lot of methods to deal with time series data, such as resampling, gap-filling, and computing descriptive statistics. Another important functionality of `pandas` are the `pandas.read_csv` and related methods, which facilitate the loading of data from csv-files and other popular data storage formats.  Pastas requires all time series to be provided as `pandas.Series` with a `pandas.DatetimeIndex`; examples are provided. For more information and user guidance on `pandas` please see their documentation website (https://pandas.pydata.org).\n",

    "## Validating user-provided time series\n",
    "\n",
    "As is clear from the descriptions above, the user is required to provide time series in a certain format and with certain characteristics, depending on the type of time series. To prevent issues later in the modeling chain, all user-provided time series are internally checked to make sure all requirements are met. This is done using the `pastas.validate_stress` and `pastas.validate_oseries` methods, which can also be called directly by the user. Let's look at the docstring of these methods to see what is checked:"

How these two operations are performed depends on the `settings` that are provided. An appropriate setting must be specified when creating a `StressModel` object. \n",

It can be seen, for example, that when the setting is `prec` (precipitation), a missing value is replaced by the value zero (`fill_nan=0.0` in the table) and when the series has to be extended in the past, it is filled with the mean value of the provided series (`fill_before=mean` in the table).
