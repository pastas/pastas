    "# Response functions\n",
    "This notebook provides an overview of the response functions that are available in Pastas. Response functions describe the response of the dependent variable (an `oseries` like groundwater heads) to an independent variable (a stress like precipitation or groundwater pumping) and form a fundamental part in approach implemented in Pastas. Depending on the problem under investigation, a response function may be required with a certain shape or with more degrees of freedom (parameters). Response functions are generally used in combination with a stress model, but in this notebook the response functions are discussed independently to provide an overview of the different response functions and what they represent."

When $n=1$, the Gamma response is the same as the Exponential response. When $n<1$ there is an immediate response. The response function is the most used response function in Pastas, as its shape is versatile and able to mimic many responses found in the field (it is also used in many other parts of hydrology to simulate a hydrological response).
