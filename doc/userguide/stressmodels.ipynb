    "In this notebook we give a quick start guide to StressModels in Pastas. Pastas uses smaller submodels to translate one or multiple hydrological stress(es) (e.g., precipitation, river stages) to a contribution to the head fluctuations. The submodels are named \"stress models\" in Pastas. All stress models are contained in the `stressmodels` module. There are different stress models for a variety of use-cases. It is the task of the hydrologist to select a specific stress model to simulate the head contribution from a particular stress. \n",
