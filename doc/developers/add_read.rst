===================
Adding read methods
===================
In this section it is described what steps need to be taken to add a "read"
method to Pastas. The way this subpackage is structured allows for the
easy implementation of your own read methods. The Pastas read subpackage
is meant for importing timeseries from files or download.

Steps to be taken:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Add your python script (E.g. read_new.py) that contains a function or
class to read the data (E.g. MyReader). The name of this function should
start with `read`, followed by an underscore and the name of the import
source (e.g. `ps.read_knmi`).

2. Make a new class (E.g. mydata) that inherits from DataModel class and
parses all available attributes as provided in the DataModel.

3. Add the correct import statement to the __init__.py in the read folder.
