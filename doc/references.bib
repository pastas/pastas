	abstract = {Water fluxes in catchments are controlled by physical processes and material properties that are complex, heterogeneous, and poorly characterized by direct measurement. As a result, parsimonious theories of catchment hydrology remain elusive. Here I describe how one class of catchments (those in which discharge is determined by the volume of water in storage) can be characterized as simple first-order nonlinear dynamical systems, and I show that the form of their governing equations can be inferred directly from measurements of streamflow fluctuations. I illustrate this approach using data from the headwaters of the Severn and Wye rivers at Plynlimon in mid-Wales. This approach leads to quantitative estimates of catchment dynamic storage, recession time scales, and sensitivity to antecedent moisture, suggesting that it is useful for catchment characterization. It also yields a first-order nonlinear differential equation that can be used to directly simulate the streamflow hydrograph from precipitation and evapotranspiration time series. This single-equation rainfall-runoff model predicts streamflow at Plynlimon as accurately as other models that are much more highly parameterized. It can also be analytically inverted; thus, it can be used to ?do hydrology backward,? that is, to infer time series of whole-catchment precipitation directly from fluctuations in streamflow. At Plynlimon, precipitation rates inferred from streamflow fluctuations agree with rain gauge measurements as closely as two rain gauges in each catchment agree with each other. These inferred precipitation rates are not calibrated to precipitation measurements in any way, making them a strong test of the underlying theory. The same approach can be used to estimate whole-catchment evapotranspiration rates during rainless periods. At Plynlimon, evapotranspiration rates inferred from streamflow fluctuations exhibit seasonal and diurnal cycles that agree semiquantitatively with Penman-Monteith estimates. Thus, streamflow hydrographs may be useful for reconstructing precipitation and evapotranspiration records where direct measurements are unavailable, unreliable, or unrepresentative at the scale of the landscape.},

	abstract = {In tributaries impacted by non-point source pollution, flux rates often are proportional to flow. Since adequate pollutant concentration data are lacking for many river systems, but flow data are often available, measures of flow variability may be the only source of information for planning monitoring programs or evaluating the behavior of tributaries on a basin-wide scale. Seven measures of flow variability were developed, and their characteristics were examined using flow data from Great Lakes tributaries. Classifications of the tributaries based on flow variability were compared with an event-responsiveness classification of earlier investigators. Lack of agreement is conspicuous, and can be attributed in part to an inadequate chemical data base for many rivers when the earlier classification was established. Cluster analysis was used to reveal the natural groupings of 118 U.S. and Canadian Great Lakes tributaries, based on measures of flow variability. The resulting classification of the tributaries is geographically coherent, and demonstrates that large areas of high flow variability are found in the western and central Lake Erie drainage basin, probably as a result of intense agricultural land use in association with heavy soils. Tributaries draining urban areas also tend to have high flow variability. Most of the tributaries which drain the northern Great Lakes watershed have low flow variability.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the notion of similarity often used in the regionalization studies of hydrological models. We compare two different visions of similarity: the apparent similarity defined on the basis of observable catchment properties, and behavioral similarity judged through the use of hydrological models. These two visions are generally assumed to be merged in regionalization studies: Catchments having apparently similar physical characteristics are assumed to have a similar hydrological behavior. In this paper, we wished to test the validity of this assumption. To this aim, we defined behavioral (hydrological) similarity on the basis of model parameter transferability. Then pools of hydrologically similar catchments are compared with pools of apparently physically similar catchments, as identified on the basis of physiographic catchment descriptors. The overlap between the two pools of similar catchments is analyzed, making it possible to judge the efficiency of the physical similarity measure and to identify hydrologically similar catchments in an ungauged context. The results show that the overlap between the two pools is significant for only 60\% of the catchments. For the other catchments, two major reasons were identified as contributing to the lack of overlap: (1) these catchments often have a quite specific hydrological behavior and (2) the role of the underground properties of the catchment on its hydrological behavior was not found to be accurately described by the available physical descriptors, meaning that more relevant catchment descriptors should be sought to better describe the geological and lithological context in hydrological terms.},

For glacier basins in particular, inferences concerning catchment-scale processes have been developed from the varying form and magnitude of the diurnal hydrograph in the proglacial river. To date, however, such classifications of proglacial diurnal hydrographs have developed in a relatively subjective manner. This paper develops an objective approach to the classification of diurnal discharge hydrograph ?shape? and ?magnitude? using a combination of principal components analysis and cluster analysis applied to proglacial discharge time-series and to diurnal bulk flow indices. The procedure is applied to discharge time-series from two different glacier basins and four separate ablation seasons representing a gradient of increasing hydrological perturbation as a result of (i) variable water inputs generated by rainstorm activity and (ii) variable location and response of hydrological stores through a systematic decrease in catchment glacierized area. The potential of the technique for application in non-glacial hydrological contexts is discussed. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

For the study we used 35 flow variables for 62 New Zealand perennial rivers, which cover a wide range of flow regimes. All flow variables were calculated using daily mean flows from a common 7-year period. They included general flow variables (which express general features without focusing on extreme flows, such as mean flow and coefficient of variation), high flow variables and low flow variables. Four groups of variables were identified based on covariance among the sites through a principal components analysis. These groups were: (1) the size of the river (central tendency of magnitude); (2) the overall variability of flow (including magnitude of high and low flows); (3) the volume of high flows; and (4) the frequency of high flow events. The ecological relevance of each of the four groups is discussed. We also examined statistical properties of the flow variables such as the inter-annual variability, which was low for the general flow variables and high for variables that characterize the highest floods. We recommend that a suite of different variables representing each of the identified groups be used in riverine ecological studies in order that the different facets of flow regimes be adequately represented.},

Two distinct seed morphs?large, light seeds and small, dark seeds?are produced by individual A. triangularis plants. Experimental populations consisting of seed size monocultures (large or small seeds) and seed size mixtures were established at three different densities, and the time of germination, plant size, plant survivorship, and plant fecundity were monitored. Marked variation in time of germination was observed among treatments and between seed sizes, but germination within any given treatment occurred over a five- to ten-day period. Large seeds produced larger plants than small seeds did, and this dichotomy was maintained over the course of the entire experiment. Germination date and seed size interacted such that larger plants grew from seeds which germinated earlier than those which germinated later, regardless of seed size. Germination date had a more pronounced effect than seed size did on plant mortality in high density populations. At high density, large seed monocultures experienced greater mortality than small seed monocultures did, but in seed size mixtures, the mortality was evenly distributed between plants from the two seed sizes. Regardless of density conditions and parentage, large and small seeds were produced in equal proportion by the plants. Total seed production, however, was dramatically affected by plant density, and to a lesser degree by germination date. Although seed size effects alone did not appear to affect directly final plant biomass and fecundity, effects of seed size early in ontogeny may have contributed to differences in fecundity.},

	abstract = {We analyze the controls on flood duration based on the concept of comparative hydrology. Rather than modeling a single catchment in detail, we compare catchments with contrasting characteristics in order to understand the controls in a holistic way. We analyze the hydrographs of 9223 maximum annual flood events in 396 Austrian catchments ranging from 5 to ?10,000 km2 as a function of climatic controls such as storm type (synoptic and convective storms, rain-on-snow, snowmelt), and catchment controls such as soils, soil moisture, geology, and land form. The ratio of the flood volume and the flood peak is used as a measure of the flood duration or flood timescale. The results indicate that, spatially, the median flood timescales range from 16 h in the hilly catchments, where convective storms prevail, to 104 h in the lowland catchments where substantial inundation into the floodplain occurs. The range is even larger for different flood types, from 7 h for flash floods in the hilly catchments to 200 h for snowmelt floods in an Alpine area with deeply weathered rocks and deep soils. The results also indicate that the catchment area is not the most important control on the flood timescales. For the range of catchments considered here, climate is very important through storm type and antecedent soil moisture, and geology is very important through soil characteristics. The concept of comparative hydrology is also used to interpret the interplay of the processes controlling the flood duration at timescales from hours to millennia. It is argued that the flood timescale is a rich fingerprint of the hydrological processes in a catchment because it integrates a range of climate and catchment characteristics by a time parameter.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The term flashiness reflects the frequency and rapidity of short term changes in streamflow, especially during runoff events. Flashiness is an important component of a stream's hydrologic regime. A variety of land use and land management changes may lead to increased or decreased flashiness, often to the detriment of aquatic life. This paper presents a newly developed flashiness index, which is based on mean daily flows. The index is calculated by dividing the pathlength of flow oscillations for a time interval (i.e., the sum of the absolute values of day-to-day changes in mean daily flow) by total discharge during that time interval. This index has low interannual variability, relative to most flow regime indicators, and thus greater power to detect trends. Index values were calculated for 515 Midwestern streams for the 27-year period from 1975 through 2001. Statistically significant increases were present in 22 percent of the streams, primarily in the eastern portion of the study area, while decreases were present in 9 percent, primarily in the western portion. Index values tend to decrease with increasing watershed area and with increasing unit area ground water inputs. Area compensated index values often shift at ecoregion boundaries. Potential index applications include evaluation of programs to restore more natural flow regimes.},

Within the European Union, Habitat Directives are developed with the aim of restoration and preservation of endangered species. The level of biodiversity in coastal dune systems is generally very high compared to other natural ecosystems, but suffers from deterioration. Groundwater extraction and urbanisation are the main reasons for the decrease in biodiversity. Many restoration actions are being carried out and are focusing on the restoration of groundwater level with the aim of re-establishing rare species. These actions have different degrees of success. The evaluation of the actions is mainly based on the appearance of red list species. The groundwater classes, developed in the Netherlands, are used for the evaluation of opportunities for vegetation, while the natural variability of the groundwater level and quality are under-estimated. Vegetation is used as a seepage indicator. The existing classification is not valid in the Belgian dunes, as the vegetation observed in the study area is not in correspondence with this classification. Therefore, a new classification is needed. The new classification is based on the variability of the groundwater level on a long term with integration of ecological factors. Based on the new classification, the importance of seasonal and inter-yearly fluctuations of the water table can be deduced. Inter-yearly fluctuations are more important in recharge areas while seasonal fluctuations are dominant in discharge areas. The new classification opens opportunities for relating vegetation and groundwater dynamics.},

Improved quantitative evaluations of human-induced hydrologic changes are needed to advance research on the biotic implications of hydrologic alteration and to support ecosystem management and restoration plans. We propose a method for assessing the degree of hydrologic alteration attributable to human influence within an ecosystem. This method, referred to as the ?Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration,? is based upon an analysis of hydrologic data available either from existing measurement points within an ecosystem (such as at stream gauges or wells) or model-generated data. We use 32 parameters, organized into five groups, to statistically characterize hydrologic variation within each year. These 32 parameters provide information on ecologically significant features of surface and ground water regimes influencing aquatic, wetland, and riparian ecosystems. We then assess the hydrologic perturbations associated with activities such as dam operations, flow diversion, groundwater pumping, or intensive land-use conversion by comparing measures of central tendency and dispersion for each parameter between user-defined ?pre-impact? and ?post-impact? time frames, generating 64 Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration. This method is intended for use with other ecosystem metrics in inventories of ecosystem integrity, in planning ecosystem management activities, and in setting and measuring progress toward conservation or restoration goals.},

	abstract = {Abstract Time series of groundwater head measurements serve as a primary source of information on groundwater systems. In different groundwater systems, and across several scales, we observe a multitude of patterns in groundwater time series, resulting from complex hydrogeological setups. Unlike in surface hydrology, there is no generalized classification to categorize and quantify the dynamics in groundwater time series. This leads to a lack of tools that could help us disentangle the information contained in groundwater time series in a systematic way. To approach such a classification, we present a principle for organization to qualitatively describe and quantify groundwater dynamics in a non-redundant and data efficient way. We devise a descriptive typology of groundwater dynamics and assign quantitative measures, mathematically expressing these dynamics. Based on an extensive data set of daily groundwater hydrographs from Central Europe, we analyze the relationship between indices and typology based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The PCA is also used to investigate and discuss redundancy, i.e. indices expressing similar information content of hydrographs. Further, we investigate the indices? sensitivity to measurement interval and length of the overall observed period. A case study demonstrates the potential of the typology and index approach to link groundwater dynamics to the underlying hydrogeological process controls. The tools provided for characterization and quantification of groundwater dynamics should improve future efforts of groundwater classification and prediction in ungauged aquifers and other applications.},

	abstract = {A non-linear state space model is developed for describing groundwater fluctuations. Non-linearity is introduced by modeling the (unobserved) degree of water saturation of the root zone. The non-linear relations are based on physical concepts describing the dependence of both the actual evapotranspiration and the percolation rate on the degree of saturation of the root zone. Precipitation and reference evaporation are the input variables. Recharge from the root zone is transferred through the percolation zone to the water table by means of a linear reservoir model. The flux in the percolation zone is assumed to be independent of the groundwater level. Errors due to model assumptions and parameter uncertainties are modeled as a noise process. The parameters of the resulting stochastic model are calibrated on time series by combining an extended Kalman filter with a maximum-likelihood criterion. The model is tested at two locations and compared with a linear time series model. It is shown that the non-linear model estimated extreme groundwater levels better than the linear time series model. The variance of the stochastic component reduced significantly. This implies that effects from natural influences can be separated from non-natural influences with less uncertainty. Another advantages of the non-linear model is that it also gives an indication of fluctuations in the degree of saturation in the root zone.},

	abstract = {Environmental processes frequently exhibit threshold-type behavior, e.g., the initiation of fluxes such as snowmelt, recharge, and quick flow. Incorporating such thresholds into hydrological models introduces discontinuities into the objective functions used in model calibration, making parameter estimation unnecessarily more difficult. Moreover, this study shows that model thresholds can produce spurious multimodality in least squares objective functions even if the underlying model is near linear in its parameters. In contrast, smoothing the model with respect to its parameters and inputs yields differentiable objective functions and, in some cases, can also improve its macroscale characteristics by removing spurious secondary optima. This simplifies model calibration and sensitivity analysis by reducing the complexity of objective functions and permitting the use of powerful derivative-based analysis methods such as Newton-type optimization and Hessian-based uncertainty assessment. This paper details smoothing strategies for several classes of thresholds and discontinuities commonly found in hydrological models, including step and angle discontinuities in the constitutive functions and flux constraints arising from conservation laws in the governing differential equations. The smoothing algorithms and their parameters are selected to ensure infinite differentiability of the model and its objective functions while preserving the macroscale behavior of the original governing equations. The improvements in the structure of the model and its objective functions are illustrated empirically for a degree-day-based snow model. The smoothing techniques are general and can be applied to other models with thresholds.},

(SS)TARSO models are used to simulate realizations of water table depths with lengths of 30 years, from which characteristics such as durations of exceedance are computed. The simulation performance of the fitted (SS)TARSO models is compared with results obtained from transfer function noise (TFN) models, dynamic regression (DR) models, and with a physical descriptive model, called SWATRE, extended with additional autoregressive moving average(ARMA) processes for the noise (SWATRE+ARMA). As compared to the linear TFN and DR models the (SS)TARSO models perform better because they incorporate several regimes. These regimes are the result of different soil layers or drainage levels. Furthermore, it is interesting that (SS)TARSO models show a good relative performance as compared to the SWATRE+ARMA models. A possible reason may be that inputs of SWATRE are uncertain.},

Standard time series analysis revealed a discrepancy between modeled and observed heads in several piezometers indicating a possible change in the groundwater regime. A new time series modeling approach is developed to simulate the transition from the initial regime to the altered regime. The transition is modeled as a weighted sum of two responses, one representing the initial state of the system, the other representing the altered state. The inferred timing and magnitude of the change provided strong evidence that the transition was the result of significant dredging works that increased the river bed conductance of the main river draining the aquifer. The plausibility of this explanation is corroborated by an analytical model. This case study and the developed approach to identify a change in the groundwater regime, are meant to stimulate a more systematic application of time series analysis to detect and understand changes in groundwater systems which may easily go unnoticed in groundwater flow modeling.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a nonlinear transfer function noise model for time-series modeling of unconfined groundwater hydrographs. The motivation for its development was that existing groundwater time-series models were unable to simulate large recharge events and multiyear droughts. This was because existing methods do not partition rainfall to runoff and do not account for nonlinear soil water drainage. To account for these nonlinear processes, a vertically integrated soil moisture module was added to an existing transfer function noise model. The soil moisture module has a highly flexible structure that allowed 84 different forms to be built. Application of the time-series model requires numerical calibration of parameters for the transfer functions, noise model and, for the nonlinear models, the soil moisture module. This was undertaken using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) global calibration scheme. However, reproducible calibration to the global optima was challenging and a number of modifications were required to the transfer function noise model. In trialing the 84 nonlinear models and 2 linear models, each was applied to eleven observation bores within a paired catchment study area in Great Western, Victoria, Australia. In comparison with existing groundwater hydrograph time-series models, the proposed nonlinear time-series model performed significantly better at all observation bores during calibration and evaluation periods. Both the linear and nonlinear models were also used to quantify the impact of revegetation within the paired catchment; however, results were inconclusive, which is likely due to time-series data for the state of the revegetation being unavailable. By analyzing the application of 84 nonlinear models to each bore, an optimal structure for the soil moisture module was identified. It is unlikely, however, that this model structure would be appropriate for all climates and geologies. To encourage further investigations, open-source code for the highly flexible groundwater time-series modeling framework is available and we invite others to develop new models.},

In this paper, we comment on some recent numerical and analytical work to evaluate the Hantush Well Function. We correct an expression found in a Comment by Nadarajah [Nadarajah, S., 2007. A comment on numerical evaluation of Theis and Hantush–Jacob well functions. Journal of Hydrology 338, 152–153] to a paper by Prodanoff et al.

We subsequently derived another analytic representation based on a generalized hypergeometric function in two variables and from the hydrological literature we cite an analytic representation by Hunt [Hunt, B., 1977. Calculation of the leaky aquifer function. Journal of Hydrology 33, 179–183]. We have implemented both representations and compared the results. Using a convergence accelerator Hunt’s representation of Hantush Well Function is efficient and accurate. While checking our implementations we found that Bear’s table of the Hantush Well Function [Bear, J., 1979. Hydraulics of Groundwater. McGraw-Hill, New York, Tables 8–6] contains a number of typographical errors that are not present in the original table published by Hantush [Hantush, M.S., 1956. Analysis of data from pumping tests in leaky aquifers. Transactions, American Geophysical Union 37, 702–714]. Finally, we offer a very fast approximation with a maximum relative error of 0.0033 for the parameter range in the table given by Bear.},

	abstract = {Groundwater, water in the ground. Although it is invisible, it is a vital resource for all terrestrial life (whether direct or indirect). Many processes interact with it. Rain recharges it, as it infiltrates the soil. Plant roots take it up, and their leaves evaporate it. It discharges to rivers and streams, and is abstracted with pumping wells. It is controlled with ditches and drainage means. Such processes and activities leave their traces in the groundwater level fluctuations. Careful analysis of these fluctuations may reveal much of the functioning of systems, and of the effects of individual factors. This is shown by many, but practiced by too few, as traditional time series analysis theory and software are complex.

In this thesis, a new method of time series analysis is presented. Its continuous time formulation fits existing physical-hydrologic theory and methods well. It is shown that groundwater level responses generally take the shape of simple distribution functions. This notion, combined with the program Menyanthes that was developed, enable the quick and easy analysis of large numbers of time series. The spatial patterns that emerge in the results of multiple models literally add another dimension to the technique. As time series models are usually accurate also, they may be valuable to every (eco)hydrologist.},

In section 2, the discrete Box-Jenkins (BJ) model is presented and transformed into continuous time to obtain the PIRFICT model. The discrete transfer function of a BJ model, which is made up of a variable number of parameters, is replaced by a simple analytical expression that defines the IR function. From the IR function, block response functions are derived that enable the model to handle irregularly spaced data. In the example application, the parameter estimates and performance of the BJ and PIRFICT model are compared using a data set of 15 piezometers and a simulated series. It was found that the estimated transfer and BR functions of both models follow the same general pattern, although the BJ transfer functions are partly irregular.

We compare the linear interpolation technique and different approaches for analyzing the correlation functions and persistence of irregularly sampled time series, as Lomb-Scargle Fourier transformation and kernel-based methods. In a thorough benchmark test we investigate the performance of these techniques.  All methods have comparable root mean square errors (RMSEs) for low skewness of the inter-observation time distribution. For high skewness, very irregular data, interpolation bias and RMSE increase strongly. We find a 40 \% lower RMSE for the lag-1 autocorrelation function (ACF) for the Gaussian kernel method vs. the linear interpolation scheme,in the analysis of highly irregular time series. For the cross correlation function (CCF) the RMSE is then lower by 60 \%. The application of the Lomb-Scargle technique gave results comparable to the kernel methods for the univariate, but poorer results in the bivariate case. Especially the high-frequency components of the signal, where classical methods show a strong bias in ACF and CCF magnitude, are preserved when using the kernel methods.  We illustrate the performances of interpolation vs. Gaussian kernel method by applying both to paleo-data from four locations, reflecting late Holocene Asian monsoon variability as derived from speleothem δ18O measurements. Cross correlation results are similar for both methods, which we attribute to the long time scales of the common variability. The persistence time (memory) is strongly overestimated when using the standard, interpolation-based, approach. Hence, the Gaussian kernel is a reliable and more robust estimator with significant advantages compared to other techniques and suitable for large scale application to paleo-data.},
