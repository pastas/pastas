This is necessary because the parameters for the non-linear recharge models are defined in mm for the length unit and days for the time unit. It is possible to use other units, but this would require manually setting the initial values and parameter boundaries for the recharge models."

    "## A few things to keep in mind:\n",
    "Below are a few things to keep in mind while using the (non-linear) recharge models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The use of an appropriate warmup period is necessary, so make sure the precipitation and evaporation are available some time (e.g., one year) before the calibration period.\n",
    "- Make sure that the units of the precipitation fluxes are in mm/day and that the DatetimeIndex matches exactly.\n",
    "- It may be possible to fix or vary certain parameters, dependent on the problem. Obtaining better initial parameters may be possible by solving without a noise model first (`ml.solve(noise=False)`) and then solve it again using a noise model.\n",
    "- For relatively shallow groundwater levels (e.g., < 10 meters), it may be better to use the `Exponential` response function as the the non-linear models already cause a delayed response.\n",
