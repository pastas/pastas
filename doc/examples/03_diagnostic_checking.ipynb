    "## Introduction\n",
    "Diagnostic checking is a common step in the time series modeling process, subjecting a calibrated model to various statistical tests to ensure that the model adequately describes the observed time series [(Hipel & McLeod, 2005)](#References). Diagnostics checks are performed on the residual or noise series of a model, depending on whether or not a noisemodel was applied in the modeling process. We will refer to the series that was minimized during parameter estimation as the \"residuals\". In practice in Pastas models, these can come from `ml.noise()` or `ml.residuals()`. Regardless of this, the diagnostics tests that may be performed remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why to check: reasons to diagnose\n",
    "Before we start the discussion of what to check, let's briefly discuss why we would want to perform diagnostic checks at all. In general, diagnostic checks should be performed when you want to make inferences with a model, in particular when the estimated standard errors of the parameters are used to make such inferences. For example, if you want to draw the confidence interval of the estimated step response for a variable, you will use the standard errors of the parameters to do so. This assumes that the standard errors are estimated accurately, which may assumed if the minimized residual series agree with a number of assumptions on the characteristics of the model residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b>Rule-of-thumb:</b> \n",
    "    \n",
    "when the standard errors of the parameters are used, the model residuals should be diagnostically checked.\n",
    "    \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to check: assumptions of white noise\n",
    "The methods used for the estimation of these standard errors assume that the model residuals behave as white noise with a mean of zero and noise values that are independent from each other (i.e., no significant autocorrelation). Additionally, it is often assumed that the residuals are homoscedastic (i.e., have a constant variance) and follow a normal distribution. The first two assumptions are the most important, having the largest impact on the estimated standard errors of the parameters [(Hipel & McLeod, 2005)](#References). Additionally to these four assumptions, the model residuals should be uncorrelated with any of the input time series. If the residuals are found to behave as white noise, we may assume that the standard errors of the parameters have been accurately estimated and we may use them for inferential analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to check: visualization & hypothesis testing\n",
    "The assumptions outlined above may be checked through different types of visualization and hypothesis testing of the model residuals. For the latter, statistical tests are used to test the hypothesis that the residuals are e.g., independent, homoscedastic, or normally distributed. These tests typically test a hypothesis with some version of the following Null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the Alternative hypothesis ($H_A$):\n",
    "\n",
    "- $H_0$: The residuals are independent, homoscedastic, or normally distributed\n",
    "- $H_A$: The residuals are not independent, homoscedastic, or normally distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "All hypothesis tests compute a certain test statistic (e.g., $Q_{test}$), which is compared to a theoretical value according to a certain distribution (e.g., $\\chi^2_{\\alpha, h}$) that depends on the level of significance (e.g., $\\alpha=0.05$) and sometimes the degrees of freedom $h$. The result of a hypothesis test either rejects the Null hypothesis or fails to reject the Null hypothesis, but can never be used to accept the Alternative hypothesis. For example, if an hypothesis test for autocorrelation fails to reject the hypothesis we may conclude that there is no significant autocorrelation in the residuals, but cannot conclude that there is no autocorrelation.

For example, some of the tests are only valid when used on equidistant time series. Other tests are sensitive to too few observation (e.g., Ljung-Box) or too many observations (e.g., Shapiroo-Wilk). In the following sections each of these hypothesis tests is discussed in more detail.
