We do not know the absolute size of this step trend, only the time when it has taken place (1st of July 2012). The `StepModel` is available in Pastas to add a step trend to a model. This stress model does not require a independent time series, but a(indication of) the date of the system change instead. By deault the `StepModel` applies an instantaneous step in the groundwater level, using the `One` response function. it is however also possible to choose a more gradual change by applying another type of response function."
