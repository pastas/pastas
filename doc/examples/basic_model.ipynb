    "### 8. Improvement: estimate evaporation factor\n",
    "In the previous model, the recharge was estimated as precipitation minus potential evaporation. A better model is to estimate the actual evaporation as a factor (called the evaporation factor here) times the potential evaporation. First, new model is created (called `ml2` here so that the original model `ml` does not get overwritten). Second, the `RechargeModel` object with a `Linear` recharge model is created, which combines the precipitation and evaporation series and adds a parameter for the evaporation factor `f`. The `RechargeModel` object is added to the model, the model is solved, and the results and statistics are plotted to the screen. Note that the new model gives a better fit (lower root mean squared error and higher explained variance), but that the Akiake information criterion indicates that the addition of the additional parameter does not improve the model signficantly (the Akaike criterion for model `ml2` is higher than for model `ml`)."
