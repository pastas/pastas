Therefore it can be added to any model. It adds two extra parameters: the level above and the factor by which the groundwater levels are damped. It is very effective for simulating the selected groundwater series. The $R^2$ value increases from 87% to 96%. We can see that the fit with the observations is much better, for both low and high measurement values."

    "Compared to the ThresholdTransform the simulation is not only damped above the threshold, but also the response time is changed above the threshold. A large drawback of the TarsoModel however is that it only allows the Exponential response function and it cannot be combined with other model elements (stressmodels, constant or transform). Therefore, all those other elements are removed from the model."
