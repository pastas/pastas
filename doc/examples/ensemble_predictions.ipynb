    "This notebook shows how to use Pastas and meteorological ensemble forecasts to generate ensemble groundwater predictions (EGPs). The goal is to forecast the groundwater levels for a well in Switzerland (Gossau), one month ahead. Meteorological ensemble forecasts of the ECMWF with 51 ensemble members are used as data input. These members represent the uncertainty in the meteorological input data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pastas model is calibrated on 10 years of head data prior to the start of the forecast, using meteorological data provided by MeteoSwiss. In this example, meteorological forecasts are used, but it is straightforward to extend this to other input data such as ensembles of pumping forecasts.\n",
