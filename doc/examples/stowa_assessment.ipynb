                "Here we present a number of steps that are commonly used to assess time series models. There is no such thing as a definitive step-by-step plan for model evaluation, so there are also other methods not included in this notebook. The order of the steps is not fixed, but logically structured according to the authors' insights.\n",
                "\n",
                "- **Visual Evaluation:** A good first step is often a visual inspection of the time series model. The behavior of the model is visually inspected, which often provides many valuable insights. The downside of this step is that it can be relatively time-consuming when many models are involved.\n",
                "\n",
                "- **Fit Statistics:** The second step involves assessing the agreement between model and measurements (the fit) based on statistical measures. The advantage of this step is that it provides an objective measure of how well the model matches the data. The downside is that a lot of valuable information is lost when reducing the model’s performance to just a few numbers.\n",
                "\n",
                "- **Model Testing:** The third step is testing the model (often called validation), for example by simulating a period of measurements that was not used in calibration. This tests how well the model performs on data that was not used to optimize the model parameters.\n",
                "\n",
                "- **Model Uncertainty:** The fourth step involves considering the model’s uncertainty. This raises the question: can the model parameters be reliably estimated? Before this uncertainty can be assessed, the model must meet certain statistical requirements. If the model does not meet these requirements, the uncertainty of the parameters cannot be properly evaluated—and therefore cannot be used in the assessment. The parameters may be well estimated, but their uncertainties are not.\n",
                "\n",
                "- **Hydrological Evaluation:** The final step we present here is the hydrological evaluation, where the results of the time series models are compared with hydrological knowledge of the system. This can be done for individual time series models as well as spatially across the results of multiple models. Here, hydrological system knowledge is used to assess the models, but the model results are also used to expand our understanding of the hydrological system."

Cross-validation (in English: 'split-sample testing') is a commonly used method in rainfall-runoff hydrology to test models. It is a way to assess the predictive value of a model. In this method, we split a time series into two parts: a training part and a test part. The part of the measurements we use to calibrate the model is called the training set. We then use the calibrated model to compute a simulation for the second period. This part is called the test set. We compare the test set to the measurements to evaluate whether the model also performs well for the part it was not calibrated on. A time series must be sufficiently long and contain enough measurements to be split into a training part and a test part.\n",
