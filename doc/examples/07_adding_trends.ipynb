We start with a model where we try to explain the groundwater level fluctuations using precipitation and evaporation. A simple non-linear recharge model is used to translate these fluxes into recharge and finally groundwater levels."

The change has taken place in 2012, but unfortunately no observations are available for the period when the change was made.\n",

We do not know the absolute size of this step trend, only the time when it has taken place (1st of July 2012). The `StepModel` is available in Pastas to add a step trend to a model. This stress model does not require a independent time series, but a(indication of) the date of the system change instead. By deault the `StepModel` applies an instantaneous step in the groundwater level, using the `One` response function. it is however also possible to choose a more gradual change by applying another type of response function."
