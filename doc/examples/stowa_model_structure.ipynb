    "## Basic Model Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The time series model can be described in its most general form as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h(t) = \\sum_{m=1}^M h_m(t) + d + r(t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h(t)$ is the observed groundwater head, $h_m(t)$ is the contribution of influence $m$, $d$ is the base level of the model, and $r(t)$ represents the model residuals. The total number of influences contributing to groundwater head fluctuations is $M$. This notebook mainly focuses on determining these contributions, but first a brief explanation is given about the base level $d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Base Level of the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every time series model includes a constant (here parameter $d$) that brings the model to the correct level. Although tempting, it is not always correct to assign a physical meaning to this constant. In the literature, it is sometimes referred to as the drainage base — the level to which the groundwater eventually returns when all influences are zero. Whether this interpretation is valid depends on the model. It is therefore safer to refer to $d$ simply as the base level of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods available to determine the value of the base level. One option is to take the mean of the residuals after a simulation and use this as the value for $d$. This means that parameter $d$ does not need to be estimated during calibration. Another option is to estimate $d$ as a parameter ([Collenteur et al. 2019](#References)). The advantage of this is that it also allows estimation of the uncertainty associated with this parameter. The effect of these two methods on the final results is still unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the examples in this notebook, whether or not the constant is included in the fit makes little difference to the results. This can be tested by setting the variable `fit_constant` to `True` or `False` in the following code block (note: code blocks are not displayed in the PDF version of this notebook). In the rest of this notebook, the base level $d$ is estimated during calibration.\n"

    "### Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Fluctuations in the groundwater head can arise from various causes. Often, we have an idea of which variables are important, but just as often, identifying these causes is the very goal of the modeling process. The calculated effect of a certain influence will to some extent depend on the chosen modeling approach — in other words, the way in which an influence is translated into a contribution to groundwater head fluctuations. The choice of model structure can therefore affect the model results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can roughly distinguish between two types of influences: measured and unmeasured influences. For measured influences, explanatory time series are available to determine their contribution to groundwater head fluctuations. These include, for example: precipitation, potential evaporation, extractions, surface water levels, and atmospheric pressure measurements. This type of influence can be translated into a contribution to head fluctuations using an impulse response function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For unmeasured influences, explanatory time series are often not available, and the effect of these types of influences is more difficult to determine. Examples include changes in land use and interventions in water management (e.g., filling in a ditch or dredging a canal). Some of these contributions can be accounted for by including a trend in the model. The information that the modeler must then provide is a time period or a specific moment when the change occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Response Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The translation of an explanatory time series into a contribution to groundwater head fluctuations can be done using an impulse response function [(see also von Asmuth et al., 2002)](#References). The impulse response function describes how the groundwater head responds to an impulse in the explanatory variable. There are many response functions to choose from to convert an explanatory time series into a contribution to head fluctuations. The choice of a specific response function may depend on the type of explanatory variable (e.g., precipitation or river water level), but also on the system (e.g., a thick or thin unsaturated zone).\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, a general response function with four parameters or a simplified version of it is used as the impulse response function. Depending on the system, some parameters can be fixed, reducing the number of parameters that need to be estimated. The following figure shows three impulse response functions that are each simplified versions of the 4-parameter function: Exponential, Gamma, and Hantush."

The last method is not shown here but can easily be applied. In that method, groundwater recharge or net precipitation surplus is calculated outside of the time series modeling (e.g., using a SWAP or Hydrus-1D model), and this series is then used as input and translated with a response function.\n",

From a groundwater perspective, it is questionable whether it makes sense for these responses to differ so greatly. On the other hand, the response function is also responsible for representing processes in the unsaturated zone, and since the temporal patterns of precipitation and evaporation differ, it could make sense for the responses to differ as well.\n",

Under this assumption, the precipitation surplus can first be calculated and then translated into a contribution to head fluctuations using a single response function.\n",

So in terms of this fit statistic, the models do not differ greatly. It is now up to the modeler to choose one of these models — or to use all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used method to select the \"best\" model is to assess the model performance outside the calibration period (see also the notebook on *Model Evaluation*). In the figure below, groundwater head is simulated for a period after the calibration period (2001–2006) using each model — the so-called validation period. The legend shows the Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) for each model. Now, the model with two response functions is the \"best\" model according to the NSE statistic (NSE = 0.86), while the linear and non-linear models have a slightly lower fit (NSE = 0.77).\n",

That number is the lowest for the linear model ($n = 6$); the other two models both have more parameters ($n = 8$). The AIC statistic also clearly favors the linear model. Another motivation for model selection could depend on the purpose of the modeling. For example, if we are mainly interested in low groundwater levels, linear models seem more applicable, whereas high groundwater levels are better simulated with the non-linear model.\n",

In that case, the groundwater table was close to the land surface, meaning that the root zone (or rather, the vegetation) could take up water directly from the groundwater. The linear model can simulate a negative flux for the precipitation surplus, while the non-linear model used in the previous example cannot. [Peterson et al. (2014)](#References) developed a non-linear model for deep groundwater levels and deep root systems in Australia, where water can also be extracted from the groundwater and evaporated.\n",

In such cases, a groundwater system responds differently to precipitation after a certain threshold in groundwater head has been exceeded. Among others, [Knotters et al. (1999)](#References) developed a model for this — the so-called TARSO model — in which the response to precipitation surplus depends on whether the groundwater head is above or below a specific threshold value.\n",

To determine the impact of groundwater abstraction on the groundwater head, it is important that there is some variation present in the discharge time series.

For example, it is unknown whether the discharge series must include a period without abstraction in order to detect a rise in groundwater head caused by the shutdown of pumping.\n",

A model of this kind has been described, for instance, in [Berendrecht et al. (2006)](#References). \n",

This approach is illustrated in the example below.\n",

Both abstractions occur within the same aquifer. The responses of the groundwater head to the two abstractions are therefore expected to be related. The model described above is applied to this example below."

There are many types of influences for which no time series of the change is available, but a qualitative description or timing of the change is known. Examples include a change in surface water levels in a polder where no measurements are available, a shift in vegetation type during the observation period, or gradual clogging of the riverbed, resulting in a changing response to fluctuations in surface water levels over time. Broadly, three methods can be used to account for such changes:\n",

A step trend can be used when a change in water level management has occurred that affects the groundwater head. This can be modeled as an abrupt increase (when the groundwater head responds quickly) or as a more gradual rise (when the groundwater system reacts more slowly). Different response functions can be used to describe how the groundwater head responds to such a change.\n",

In this example, the estimated step trend (parameter $step_d$) is -0.40 meters, with a standard error of ±0.10 meters.

It is recommended to test multiple model structures for simulating groundwater head before selecting a final model. In general, it is relatively easy to vary model structures to, for example, reduce the number of parameters or improve the fit. Moreover, it is also possible to use multiple models. Such a multi-model approach can give a better estimate of model uncertainty resulting from model structure [(see e.g., Singh et al., 2010 and Ferré, 2017)](#References). While this can be time-consuming for numerical groundwater models, it is relatively easy to apply multiple models when using time series models.\n",

On the other hand, many groundwater systems respond so slowly that low-frequency measurements contain sufficient information. The relationship between measurement frequency and the information content of a time series is part of ongoing research and should be considered when selecting a model structure.\n",
