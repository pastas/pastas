    "# Adding groundwater pumping\n",

    "In this example notebook it is shown how to simulate the effect of a pumping well on the groundwater levels. We will first create a TFN model with the net recharge as the single stress used to explain the observed heads. Second, this model is extended to include the effect of a pumping well on the heads by adding another stress model. The simulated heads are compared and it can be clearly seen how the addition of the pumping well improves the simulation of the heads.\n",

The rise in the heads cannot be explained by an increased precipitation or a decreased evaporation over time, and it is likely another force is driving the heads upwards. Given the location of the well, we can hypothesize that the groundwater pumping caused a lowering of the heads in the beginning of the observations, which decreased when the pumping well was shut down. A next logical step is to add the effect of the pumping well and see if it improves the simulation of the head.\n",
