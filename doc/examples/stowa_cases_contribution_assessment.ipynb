    "The figure below shows the contributions of the explanatory series to the measured groundwater head. It can be seen that variations in the water level result in a contribution of approximately -2 to 2 meters to the measured groundwater head. The watercourse contributes the most to the variation in groundwater head, while precipitation and evaporation have only a minor contribution.\n",

    "The stationary value of the response to the watercourse is 0.57 meters. This means that the groundwater head rises by 0.57 meters for every 1-meter increase in the water level of the watercourse. This aligns well with the estimate made earlier based on visual inspection of the series. It should be noted, however, that in this case the uncertainty in the magnitude of the response was not quantified.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information, the hydrologist can advise the water board. The time series model shows that the watercourse has a significant contribution on the groundwater head in the area. In addition, the model can be used to estimate how much the water level in the watercourse can be lowered before the groundwater head drops below a critical level where drought damage may occur in the area surrounding the observation well."
