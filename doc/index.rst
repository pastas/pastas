Introduction
============
Pastas is an open source Python package to analyse hydro(geo)logical time
series. The objective of Pastas is twofold: to provide a scientific
framework to develop and test new methods, and to provide a reliable
ready‐to‐use software tool for groundwater practitioners. All code is
available from the `Pastas GitHub <https://github.com/pastas/pastas>`_. Want
