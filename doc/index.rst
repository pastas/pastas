GWTSA Introduction
==================
GWTSA is an open source python package for simulating time series in the field of
hydrology. The object oriented stucture allows for the quick implementation of new
model components. Time series models can be created, calibrated, and analysed with
just a few lines of python code with the built-in optimization, visualisation, and
statistical analysis tools.
