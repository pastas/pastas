The Baltic region (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) located at the Eastern Shore of the Baltic Sea, Northern Europe.
Study focus
The spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater drought events over the period 1989–2018 was examined. Standardized Groundwater level Index (SGI) was calculated for six monitoring wells installed into shallow unconfined or semiconfined aquifers evenly distributed across the region. A set of meteorological and hydrological drought indices were used to characterize drought events using data from EAR-5 reanalysis.
New hydrological insights
Four major drought events affecting all six monitoring wells were identified: 1992–1994, 1996–1997, 2002–2004 and 2005–2007 with another episode apparently starting in 2018. Meteorological drought indices - Standardize Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) - showed the highest correlation with groundwater drought events. The ERA-5 parametrization of surface and subsurface runoff used to calculate the hydrological indices - Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) and Standardized Sub-surface Runoff Index (SSRI) - most likely did not adequately represent the hill-slope scale processes affecting the unconfined groundwater dynamics, thus indices SRI and SSRI showed less clear relationship with groundwater drought events. Different patterns of SGI fluctuations and correlation with other drought indices highlight the importance of localized meteorological, land use, geomorphological or geological factors in controlling the groundwater response to the atmospheric forcing.},

	abstract = {Non-perennial rivers and streams make up over half the global river network and are becoming more widespread. Transitions from perennial to non-perennial flow are a threshold-type change that can lead to alternative stable states in aquatic ecosystems, but it is unknown whether streamflow itself is stable in either wet (flowing) or dry (no-flow) conditions. Here, we investigated drivers and feedbacks associated with regime shifts between wet and dry conditions in an intermittent reach of the Arkansas River (USA) over the past 23 years. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that these regimes represent alternative stable states, including (a) significant jumps in discharge time series that were not accompanied by jumps in flow drivers such as precipitation and groundwater pumping; (b) a multi-modal state distribution with 92\% of months experiencing no-flow conditions for {\textless}10\% or {\textgreater}90\% of days, despite unimodal distributions of precipitation and pumping; and (c) a hysteretic relationship between climate and flow state. Groundwater levels appear to be the primary control over the hydrological regime, as groundwater levels in the alluvial aquifer were higher than the stream stage during wet regimes and lower than the streambed during dry regimes. Groundwater level variation, in turn, was driven by processes occurring at both the regional scale (surface water inflows from upstream, groundwater pumping) and the reach scale (stream–aquifer exchange, diffuse recharge through the soil column). Historical regime shifts were associated with diverse pressures including network disconnection caused by upstream water use, increased flow stability potentially associated with reservoir operations, and anomalous wet and dry climate conditions. In sum, stabilizing feedbacks among upstream inflows, stream–aquifer interactions, climate, vegetation, and pumping appear to create alternative wet and dry stable states at this site. These stabilizing feedbacks suggest that widespread observed shifts from perennial to non-perennial flow will be difficult to reverse.},

	abstract = {The high landslide risk potential along the steep hillslopes of the Eastern Andes in Ecuador provides challenges for hazard mitigation, especially in areas with hydropower dams and reservoirs. The objective of this study was to characterize, understand, and quantify the mechanisms driving the motions of the Guarumales landslide. This 1.5 km2 deep-seated, slow-moving landslide is actively moving and threatening the \&ldquo;Paute Integral\&rdquo; hydroelectric complex. Building on a long time series of measurements of surface displacement, precipitation, and groundwater level fluctuations, we analyzed the role of predisposing conditions and triggering factors on the stability of the landslide. We performed an analysis of the time series of measured groundwater levels and drainage data using transfer functions. The geological interpretation of the landslide was further revised based on twelve new drillings. This demonstrated a locally complex system of colluvium deposits overlying a schist bedrock, reaching up to 100 m. The measured displacement rates were nearly constant at 50 mm/year over the 18 years of study. However, the measurement accuracy and time resolution were too small to identify possible acceleration or deceleration phases in response to hydro-meteorological forcing. The groundwater and slope drainage data showed a lagged response to rainfall. Finally, we developed a conceptual model of the Guarumales landslide, which we hope will improve our understanding of the many other deep-seated landslides present in the Eastern Andes.},

	abstract = {The increasing availability of remotely sensed soil moisture data offers new opportunities for data-driven modelling approaches as alternatives for process-based modelling. This study presents the applicability of transfer function-noise (TFN) modelling for predicting unsaturated zone conditions. The TFN models are calibrated using SMAP L3 Enhanced surface soil moisture data. We found that soil moisture conditions are accurately represented by TFN models when exponential functions are used to define impulse-response functions. A sensitivity analysis showed the importance of using a calibrated period which is representative of the hydrological conditions for which the TFN model will be applied. The IR function parameters provide valuable information on water system characteristics, such as the total response and the response times of soil moisture to precipitation and evapotranspiration. Finally, we encourage exploring the possibilities of TFN soil moisture modelling, as predicting soil moisture conditions is promising for operational settings.},

	abstract = {In 2018–2020, meteorological droughts over Northwestern Europe caused severe declines in groundwater heads with significant damage to groundwater-dependent ecosystems and agriculture. The response of the groundwater system to different hydrological stresses is valuable information for decision-makers. In this paper, a reproducible, data-driven approach using open-source software is proposed to quantify the effects of different hydrological stresses on heads. A scripted workflow was developed using the open-source Pastas software for time series modeling of heads. For each head time series, the best model structure and relevant hydrological stresses (rainfall, evaporation, river stages, and pumping at one or more well fields) were selected iteratively. A new method was applied to model multiple well fields with a single response function, where the response was scaled by the distances between the pumping and observation wells. Selection of the best model structure was performed through reliability checking based on four criteria. The time series model of each observation well represents an independent estimate of the contribution of different hydrological stresses to the head and is based exclusively on observed data. The approach was applied to estimate the drawdown caused by nearby well fields to 250 observed head time series measured at 122 locations in the eastern part of the Netherlands, a country where summer droughts can cause problems, even though the country is better known for problems with too much water. Reliable models were obtained for 126 head time series of which 78 contain one or more well fields as a contributing stress. The spatial variation of the modeled responses to pumping at the well fields show the expected decline with distance from the well field, even though all responses were modeled independently. An example application at one well field showed how the head response to pumping varies per aquifer. Time series analysis was used to determine the feasibility of reducing pumping rates to mitigate large drawdowns during droughts, which depends on the magnitude and response time of the groundwater system to changes in pumping. This is salient information for decision-makers.
