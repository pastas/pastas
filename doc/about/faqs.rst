.. rubric:: How should I cite Pastas in general and/or a specific version?

If you find Pastas useful and use it in your research or project, we kindly
ask you to cite the Pastas article published in Groundwater journal as follows:

- Collenteur, R.A., Bakker, M., Caljé, R., Klop, S.A., Schaars, F. (2019)
  `Pastas: open source software for the analysis of groundwater time series.
  Groundwater <https://ngwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwat
  .12925>`_. doi: 10.1111/gwat.12925.

To cite a specific version of the Pastas software we recommend using the the
DOI proivded through Zenodo for every major release of the software.

- Collenteur, R., Bakker, M., Caljé, R. & Schaars, F. (XXXX). Pastas:
  open-source software for time series analysis in hydrology (Version X.X.X).
  Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1465866.

.. rubric:: What does "Pastas" stand for?

Pastas is not an acronym for something. However we like a good Pasta every
once in a while, and as that name was already taken in the Python Packaging
Index, we chose for Pastas as the name of the package.
