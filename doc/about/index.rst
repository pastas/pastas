About Pastas
============

Pastas is an open source Python package to analyse hydro(geo)logical time series. The objective of Pastas is twofold:
to provide a scientific framework to develop and test new methods, and to provide a reliable ready‐to‐use software
tool for groundwater practitioners. All code is available from the `Pastas GitHub <https://github.com/pastas/pastas>`_.

Mission
-------

Our mission is to improve the analysis and modeling of groundwater time
series through research and development of new methods and accompanying
computer code. We strive to maximize what we can learn from the information
contained in groundwater time series. We believe in the power of open science,
FAIR data and open software to achieve this, making code open and available to
all. With the development of Pastas, we attempt to bridge the gap between
science and practice and shorten the time between scientific discoveries
and their real-world applications.
