About Pastas
============

Pastas is an open source Python package to analyse hydro(geo)logical time series. The objective of Pastas is twofold:
to provide a scientific framework to develop and test new methods, and to provide a reliable ready‐to‐use software
tool for groundwater practitioners. All code is available from the `Pastas GitHub <https://github.com/pastas/pastas>`_.

Mission
-------

Our mission is to improve the analysis and modeling of groundwater time series through research and development of
new methods and accompanying computer code. We strive to increase the amount of what can be learned from the
information contained in groundwater time series. We believe in the power of open science, FAIR data and open software
to achieve this, making code open and available to all. With the development of Pastas, we bridge the gap between
science and practice and shorten the time scientific discoveries can be transferred to practice.
