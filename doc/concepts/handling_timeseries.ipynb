    "## Different types of time series\n",
    "Time series data may generally be defined as a set of data values observed at certain times, ordered in a way that the time indices are increasing. Many time series analysis method assume that the time step between the observations is regular, the time series has evenly-spaced observations. These evenly spaced time series may have missing data, but it will still be possible to lay the values on a time-grid with constant time steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is generally also assumed to be the case for the independent time series in hydrological studies. For example, the precipitation records may have some missing data but the precipitation is reported as the total rainfall over one day. In the case of missing data, we may impute a zero (no rain) or the rainfall amount from a nearby measurement station.\n",
    "\n",
    "Groundwater level time series do generally not share these characteristics with other hydrological time series, and are measured at irregular time intervals. This is especially true for historic time series that were measured by hand. The result is that the measurements can not be laid on a regular time grid.

    "We can differentiate between two types of input time series for Pastas models: the dependent and independent time series. The dependent time series are those that we want to explain (e.g., the groundwater levels) and the independent time series are those that we use to explain the dependent time series (e.g., precipitation or evaporation). The requirements for these time series are different:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dependent time series may be of any kind: regular, missing data or irregular.\n",
    "- The independent time series has to have regular time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this means that the time series provided to `pastas.Model` may be of any kind, and that the time series used by the stressmodels (e.g., `pastas.RerchargeModel`) need to have regular time steps. The regular time steps  are required to simulate contributions to the groundwater level fluctuations. As there are virtually no restrictions on the dependent time series, the remainder of this notebook will discuss primarily the independent time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does the TimeSeries object validate a time series?\n",
    "To ensure that a time series can be used for simulation a number of things are checked and changed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure the values are floats. Values are change to dtype=float if not.\n",
    "2. Make sure the index is a `pandas.DatetimeIndex`. Index is changed if not.\n",
    "3. Make sure the timestamps in the index are increasing. Index is sorted if not.\n",
    "4. Make sure there are no nan-values at the start and end of a time series.\n",
    "5. Determine the frequency of the time series.\n",
    "6. Make sure there are no duplicate indices. Values are averaged if this is the case.\n",
    "7. Remove or fill up nan-values, depending on the settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these steps an INFO message will be returned by Pastas to inform the user if a change is made. The first four steps generally do not have a large impact and are there to prevent some basic issues. Preferably, no changes are reported. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequency of the input data\n",
    "Pastas tries to determine the frequency in step 5, and will **always** report the result. It is generally good practice to double-check if the reported frequency agrees with what you know about the time series. Pastas will also report if no frequency can be inferred. If no frequency is reported there is probably some wrong and the user should fix either fix the input time series or provide Pastas with more information.\n",
