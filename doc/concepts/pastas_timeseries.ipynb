    "If all of the above is OK, a TimeSeries object is returned. When valid time series are provided all of the above checks are no problem and no settings are required. However, all too often this is not the case and at least \"fill_nan\" and \"freq\" are required. The first argument tells the TimeSeries object how to handle nan-values, and the freq argument provides the frequency of the original time series (by default, freq=D, fill_nan=\"interpolate\")."

In the case of the observed groundwater levels (oseries) as in the example above, interpolating between observations might not be the preffered method to deal with gaps in your data. In fact, the do not have to be constant for simulation, one of the benefits of the method of impulse response functions. The nan-values can simply be dropped. To configure a TimeSeries object the user has three options:\n",

    "1. Use a predefined configuration by providing a string to the settings argument\n",
