      - "mean": Resample by taking the mean.
      - "sum": Resample by summing values.
      - "max": Resample with maximum value.
      - "min": Resample with minimum value.
    fill_nan : {"drop", "mean", "interpolate"} or float
      Method for filling NaNs.
      - "drop": Drop NaNs from time series.
      - "mean": Fill NaNs with mean value of time series.
      - "interpolate": Fill NaNs by interpolating between finite values.
      - float: Fill NaN with provided value, e.g. 0.0.

      - "mean": Resample time series by taking the mean.
      - "drop": Resample by taking the mean, dropping any NaN-values.
      - "sum": Resample by summing values.
      - "max": Resample with maximum value.
      - "min": Resample with minimum value.
