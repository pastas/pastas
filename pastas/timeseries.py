class TimeSeries:
    """Class that deals with all user-provided time series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series: pandas.Series
        pandas.Series with pandas.DatetimeIndex.
    name: str, optional
        String with the name of the time series, if None is provided, pastas will try
        to derive the name from the series.
    settings: str or dict, optional
        String with the name of one of the predefined settings (obtained through
        ps.TimeSeries._predefined_settings.) or a dictionary with the settings to be
        applied. This does not have to include all the settings arguments.
    metadata: dict, optional
        Dictionary with metadata of the time series.

    Returns
    -------
    series: pastas.TimeSeries
        Returns a pastas.TimeSeries object.

    Examples
    --------
    To obtain the predefined TimeSeries settings, you can run the following line of
    code:

    >>> ps.rcParams["timeseries"]

    See Also
    --------
    pastas.timeseries.TimeSeries.update_series
