class TimeSeries:
    """Class that deals with all user-provided time series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series: pandas.Series or pastas.timeseries.TimeSeries
        Pandas Series with time indices and values or a Pastas.TimeSeries
        instance. If the latter is provided, a new TimeSeries.
    name: str, optional
        String with the name of the time series, if None is provided,
        pastas will try to derive the name from the series.
    settings: str or dict, optional
        String with the name of one of the predefined settings (obtained
        through ps.TimeSeries._predefined_settings.) or a dictionary with the
        settings to be applied. This does not have to include all the
        settings arguments.
    metadata: dict, optional
        Dictionary with metadata of the time series.
    freq_original: str, optional
        By providing a frequency string here, a frequency can be forced on the
        time series if it can not be inferred with pd.infer_freq.
    **kwargs: optional
        Any keyword arguments that are provided but are not listed will be
        passed as additional settings.

    Returns
    -------
    series: pastas.timeseries.TimeSeries
        Returns a pastas.TimeSeries object.

    Examples
    --------
    To obtain the predefined TimeSeries settings, you can run the following
    line of code:

    >>> ps.rcParams["timeseries"]

    See Also
    --------
    pastas.timeseries.TimeSeries.update_series
        For the individual options for the different settings.
