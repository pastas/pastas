"""This module contains a timer for model optimization.

The timer prints the time elapsed and number of iterations. Optionally, a maximum solve
time can be specified, to abort long optimizations. This class is not automatically
imported in pastas and requires the tqdm module (pip install tqdm).

Usage::

    from pastas.timer import SolveTimer

    with SolveTimer(max_time=60) as t:  # max time in seconds
        ml.solve(callback=t.timer)

This will print the following to the console::

    Optimization progress: 73it [00:01, 67.68it/s]

"""

    from tqdm.auto import tqdm

    raise e("SolveTimer requires 'tqdm' to be installed.")

class ExceededMaxSolveTime(Exception):

class SolveTimer(tqdm):
    """Progress indicator for model optimization.

    Examples
    --------
    Print timer and number of iterations in console while running `ml.solve()`::

        with SolveTimer() as t:
            ml.solve(callback=t.timer)

    This prints the following to the console, for example::

        Optimization progress: 73it [00:01, 67.68it/s]

    Set maximum allowable time (in seconds) for solve, otherwise raise
    ExceededMaxSolveTime exception::

        with SolveTimer(max_time=60) as t:
            ml.solve(callback=t.timer)

    Notes
    -----
    If the logger is also printing messages to the console the timer will not be
    updated quite as nicely.
