    Parameters
    ----------
    sim: pandas.Series
        Series with the simulated values.
    obs: pandas.Series
        The Series with the observed values.
    missing: str, optional
        string with the rule to deal with missing values. Only "drop" is
        supported now.
    weighted: bool, optional
        Weight the values by the normalized time step to account for
        irregular time series. Default is False.
    max_gap: int, optional
        maximum allowed gap period in days to use for the computation of the
        weights. All time steps larger than max_gap are replace with the
        max_gap value. Default value is 30 days.

    Notes
    -----
    The (weighted) Kling-Gupta Efficiency :cite:t:`kling_runoff_2012` is
    computed as follows:

    .. math:: \\text{KGE} = 1 - \\sqrt{(r-1)^2 + (\\beta-1)^2 - (\\gamma-1)^2}

    where :math:`\\beta = \\bar{x} / \\bar{y}` and :math:`\\gamma =
    \\frac{\\bar{\\sigma}_x / \\bar{x}}{\\bar{\\sigma}_y / \\bar{y}}`. If
    weighted equals True, the weighted mean, variance and pearson
    correlation are used.
